### **Need for Database**

A **database** is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Before databases, data was stored in flat files, which caused several issues. The **need for a database** arises due to the following reasons:

1. **Data Redundancy Control**
   Databases eliminate or reduce data duplication by maintaining data in a centralized manner.

2. **Data Consistency**
   Centralized storage ensures that all users see the same data, reducing inconsistencies.

3. **Efficient Data Management**
   Databases provide systematic and efficient ways to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.

4. **Data Security**
   Access to data can be restricted using user roles, passwords, and permissions.

5. **Concurrency Control**
   Multiple users can access and modify data simultaneously without conflicts.

6. **Data Integrity**
   Databases enforce rules (like primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints) to maintain valid data.

7. **Backup and Recovery**
   Databases support automatic backups and allow recovery from crashes or failures.

8. **Data Independence**
   Applications are independent of how data is stored internally. Changes to the schema do not require changes in the application.

9. **Query Processing**
   Powerful query languages like SQL help in easy and complex data retrieval.
